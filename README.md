# SE-CNN for Efficient MNIST Digit Recognition
 SE-CNN-MNIST-Recognition: This project introduces an enhanced Squeeze-and-Excitation Convolutional Neural Network (SE-CNN) designed for efficient handwritten digit recognition on the MNIST dataset. Traditional CNNs suffer from reduced accuracy (e.g., dropping from 98.32% to 86.73% with 50% data) due to their dependency on large datasets and information loss during pooling. By integrating SE blocks into a baseline CNN with three convolutional layers (32, 64, 64 filters), this SE-CNN recalibrates features to maintain high accuracy—achieving ~99.2% on the full MNIST dataset and ~95% on just 50% of the data—with a low computational cost (~0.7G FLOPs). The repository includes implementation code, a detailed case study, and comprehensive documentation, supporting training, evaluation, and prediction on external images. Ideal for resource-constrained applications like IoT, this project demonstrates a robust, data-efficient alternative to conventional models, rivaling advanced architectures like CapsNet with less complexity.
